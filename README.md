Phumpkin
========

Phumpkin is a tailor-made web photo viewer. It is made for my specific purposes:

- tight [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) integration
- RAW support, specifically for Sony ARW's
- using existing library and folder structure, not importing
- open source

Unless you are looking for the same things, there are likely better general purpose alternatives for you. Some of these might include:

- [Photoprism](https://photoprism.org/) (recommended)
- [FileRun](https://filerun.com/for-photos) (not FOSS)
- [Lychee](https://lychee.electerious.com/)
- [piwigo](http://piwigo.org/)
- [koken](http://koken.me/) (not FOSS)


Objectives 
-----------

- keeps your photo folder structure in tact
- generates thumbnails outside photo library (so you can easily delete at will to free up space)
- download various JPEG sizes on demand
    - applies XMP edits for above exports
- fast viewer (no loading 20k thumbnails on one page immediately)
